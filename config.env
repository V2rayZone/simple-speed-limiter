# Simple Speed Limiter Configuration
# Network interface (use 'ip link show' to see available interfaces)
INTERFACE="eth0"

# Download limit in Mbps (ingress traffic)
DOWNLOAD_LIMIT_MBPS="10"

# Upload limit in Mbps (egress traffic)
UPLOAD_LIMIT_MBPS="10"

# IFB interface for ingress shaping (usually ifb0)
IFB_INTERFACE="ifb0"

# Additional Notes:
# - To find your network interface, run: ip link show
# - Common interfaces: eth0, ens3, enp0s3, etc.
# - Speed limits are in Mbps (Megabits per second)
# - 1 Mbps = 1000 Kbps = 125 KB/s
# - Recommended to set limits below your actual bandwidth for stability
